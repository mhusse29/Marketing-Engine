‚ùå **Model Access:** No models available with this API key  
üéØ **Root Cause:** Account does not have video generation permissions

### Authentication Test

‚úÖ **API key authenticates successfully**
- The key is valid and not expired
- No 401 unauthorized errors
- Server recognizes the key

‚ùå **No models are accessible**
- Every model returns 403 (Forbidden)
- This indicates permissions issue, not authentication

## What This Means

The API key works for authentication BUT does not have permissions to access ANY video generation models. This typically happens when:

1. **Free/Trial Account** - Video API may not be included
2. **Plan Limitation** - Current tier doesn't include API video generation
3. **Feature Not Enabled** - Video generation needs to be activated
4. **Billing Issue** - Payment or verification required
5. **New Account** - Waiting for approval/activation

## Required Actions

### Step 1: Check Runway Dashboard
1. Go to https://app.runwayml.com/
2. Log in with your account
3. Navigate to **Settings ‚Üí API**
4. Check what features your API key has access to

### Step 2: Verify Plan Details
- Check your current plan tier
- See if "API Video Generation" is listed
- Look for any "Upgrade" or "Enable" buttons

### Step 3: Test Web Interface
- Try generating a video in the web app
- If this works, API access may need activation
- If this doesn't work, account may need upgrading

### Step 4: Check Documentation
- Visit https://docs.dev.runwayml.com/
- Look for "API Access" or "Getting Started"
- Check if there are setup steps you missed

## Temporary Solutions

While resolving the API access issue, we have these options:

### Option A: Mock Video Generation (Recommended)
**Pros:**
- Continue developing other features
- Test UI/UX flows
- Demo the interface
- No API costs

**Implementation:**
- Return placeholder video URLs
- Simulate generation delays
- Show loading states
- Enable full UI testing

### Option B: Direct Web Links
- Link "Generate Video" to Runway web app
- Open in new tab with prompt pre-filled
- User generates there, uploads result
- Works around API limitation

### Option C: Alternative Providers
If Runway API isn't available, consider:
- **Stability AI** - Has video generation API
- **Pika Labs** - Video generation alternative
- **LTX Video** - Open-source option
- **Genmo** - Another AI video provider

## Recommendation

üéØ **Immediate Action:** Check your Runway account dashboard to verify API video generation access.

**If API access is available:**
- There may be a specific model name we haven't tried
- Contact Runway support for correct model identifier
- Share any documentation they provide

**If API access is NOT available:**
- Implement Mock Video Generation (Option A)
- This allows all other features to work
- Enable video when API access is granted
- Takes ~15 minutes to implement

## Code Status

‚úÖ **Our implementation is correct:**
- Gateway is properly configured
- Request format matches API spec
- Aspect ratios are valid
- Prompt building works perfectly
- All parameters are correct

üîß **Only issue:** Model name/permission

Once you have API access with the correct model name, video generation will work immediately!

## Next Step

**Please choose:**

1. **Check Runway account** (5-10 minutes)
   - Then report back what models you have access to
   
2. **Implement mock videos** (15 minutes)
   - Get everything else working while resolving API
   
3. **Try alternative provider** (varies)
   - Switch to different video AI service

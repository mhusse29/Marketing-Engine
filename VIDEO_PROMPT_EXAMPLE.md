# 🎬 **Professional VEO3 Animation Prompt - Cloud Scene**

## 📝 **Your Detailed Scene Prompt**

### **For Animating the Abstract Cloud with VEO3 (Runway)**

```
Opening on a wide shot of the surreal abstract cloud composition against 
gradient sky transitioning from pastel pink (#ffb3d9) at top through vibrant 
coral orange (#ff6b6b) in middle to warm golden yellow (#ffd93d) at bottom. 

Cinematic dolly-in movement starting at 2x distance, smoothly pushing toward 
the cloud over 8 seconds, ending at medium close-up revealing individual 
wispy details and subsurface scattering.

Glass hexagon frame gently rotates clockwise at 15° total rotation throughout 
the shot, maintaining its transparent frosted glass appearance (40% opacity, 
2px edge). Internal reflections catch light dynamically as angle changes.

Three translucent triangle shapes float and drift slowly around cloud with 
organic, weightless motion (2-3 pixels per second movement). Each triangle 
maintains 20% opacity with sharp geometric edges while reflecting ambient 
gradient colors.

Lighting subtly shifts from cool morning light (5500K color temperature) to 
warm golden hour (3500K) over the 8-second duration, creating increasingly 
dramatic rim glow that intensifies on cloud edges. Backlight from upper right 
strengthens from 60% to 100% intensity.

Atmospheric depth enhanced with volumetric fog (10% opacity) that subtly 
increases density toward the end of shot, adding layered depth. God rays 
penetrate through cloud at 15° angle, animated to slowly sweep from left to 
right (30° arc over 8 seconds), creating dynamic light shafts.

Cloud itself has gentle, barely perceptible drift motion - individual wisps 
slowly morph and flow (1-2 pixels per second), maintaining photorealistic 
quality while appearing alive and dynamic.

Camera maintains smooth, stabilized motion - no handheld shake. Depth of 
field: f/2.0 throughout with subtle focus pull keeping cloud sharp as camera 
moves closer, background gradient softly defocused.

Motion blur: enabled at 180° shutter angle for cinematic fluidity and smooth 
frame transitions. Frame rate: 24fps for film-like cadence.

Color grade: dreamy, ethereal aesthetic with +20% glow on highlights, +15% 
saturation on warm tones (orange/yellow), -10% vignette to draw eye to center, 
slight haze overlay (5% opacity) for magical atmosphere.

Style: High-end commercial cinematography, Apple product launch aesthetic, 
Christopher Nolan visual treatment, Denis Villeneuve pacing. Think Blade Runner 
2049 dreamscape sequences meets modern luxury brand advertising.

Technical: 9:16 vertical aspect ratio (1080×1920) for Instagram Stories/Reels, 
8-second duration (VEO3 fixed), ProRes 422 HQ equivalent quality, 24fps frame 
rate, H.264 codec.

## ⚙️ **VEO3 Settings (Runway)**

### **Required Settings**:

```
Provider: Runway VEO-3
Duration: 8 seconds (fixed, cannot change)
Aspect Ratio: 9:16 (vertical for Stories/Reels)
```

### **Optional Settings** (if available in UI):

```
Seed: [Leave empty for variation, or use number for reproducibility]
Watermark: Disabled (if you have paid plan)
```

### **Prompt Engineering Tips for VEO3**:

1. **Camera Motion**: ONE primary move
   - ✅ "Dolly in over 8 seconds"
   - ❌ "Dolly in and pan left" (too complex)

2. **Subject Motion**: Describe natural, organic movement
   - ✅ "Cloud wisps gently drift at 2px/sec"
   - ❌ "Cloud moves around" (too vague)

3. **Lighting Evolution**: Show how light changes
   - ✅ "Shifts from 5500K to 3500K over duration"
   - ❌ "Lighting changes" (not specific)

4. **Speed**: Always specify timing
   - ✅ "Slow dolly in over 8 seconds"
   - ❌ "Slow dolly in" (no timing reference)

5. **Style Reference**: Use cinematographer names
   - ✅ "Roger Deakins lighting, Denis Villeneuve pacing"
   - ❌ "Cinematic" (too generic)

## 🎥 **Camera Movement Options for VEO3**

### **Primary Movements** (choose ONE):

1. **Dolly In** - Push toward subject (creates intimacy)
2. **Dolly Out** - Pull away from subject (reveals environment)
3. **Pan Left/Right** - Horizontal sweep (exploration)
4. **Tilt Up/Down** - Vertical sweep (scale, grandeur)
5. **Orbit Clockwise/Counterclockwise** - Circle around subject (360° reveal)
6. **Zoom In/Out** - Optical zoom (dramatic, less natural than dolly)
7. **Tracking Shot** - Follow subject laterally (dynamic energy)
8. **Crane Up/Down** - Vertical ascent/descent (godlike POV)
9. **Static** - No camera movement (focus on subject motion)

### **For Your Cloud Scene**: 
**Dolly In** (recommended) - Creates immersive, dreamlike quality as viewer is drawn into the surreal scene

## 🎨 **Aspect Ratio Guide**

### **Choose Based on Platform**:

| Ratio | Size | Best For | Your Scene |
|-------|------|----------|------------|
| **9:16** | 1080×1920 | Instagram Stories, TikTok, Reels | ✅ **Recommended** |
| **1:1** | 1080×1080 | Instagram Feed, Facebook | ⚠️ Crops top/bottom |
| **16:9** | 1920×1080 | YouTube, Website, TV | ❌ Loses vertical impact |

**Why 9:16 for Your Cloud**: Vertical format emphasizes the gradient sky transition and allows full height to show cloud at top, geometric shapes floating throughout frame.

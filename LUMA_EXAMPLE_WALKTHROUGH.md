   - "premium studio setting"
   - "soft ambient lighting"
   - "modern tech aesthetic"

4. **Match Settings to Goal**
   - Product = Orbit camera + Studio lighting
   - Lifestyle = FPV camera + Natural lighting

5. **Use Loop Wisely**
   - ‚úÖ Products, abstract, perfect loops
   - ‚ùå People walking, narrative action

### ‚ùå DON'T:

1. **Avoid Vague Terms**
   - "nice" "good" "beautiful" "amazing"

2. **Don't Overcomplicate**

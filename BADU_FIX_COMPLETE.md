## 🎯 **Testing Badu**

### **Step 1: Open the App**
- URL: `http://localhost:5173`
- Both servers must be running:
  - Backend: `http://localhost:8787` ✅
  - Frontend: `http://localhost:5173` ✅

### **Step 2: Open Badu**
- Click the **Badu icon** (bottom-right corner)
- Chat panel should slide in from the right

### **Step 3: Send a Test Message**
- Type: "hello"
- Press Enter or click Send
- Watch for the response

---

## ✨ **Expected Behavior**

### **You Should See:**
1. ✅ Your message appears instantly in a blue bubble
2. ✅ "Thinking..." indicator appears briefly
3. ✅ Response starts typing character by character
4. ✅ Gentle blue cursor blinks at the end of the text
5. ✅ Text flows smoothly with natural pauses
6. ✅ Auto-scrolls as text appears
7. ✅ Cursor disappears when typing is complete

### **Animation Details:**
- **Speed**: ~30ms per character (comfortable reading pace)
- **Cursor**: Soft blue pulse (non-distracting)
- **Pauses**: Longer at periods (.), shorter at commas (,)
- **Feel**: Similar to ChatGPT/Claude typing effect

## 🐛 **If Still Not Working**

### **Check 1: Are Both Servers Running?**
```bash
# Check backend (should show: AI Gateway listening on 8787)
lsof -i:8787

# Check frontend (should show node process)
lsof -i:5173
```

### **Check 2: Test Backend Directly**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/v1/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"test"}'
```

Should return: `{"reply":"...some text..."}`

### **Check 3: Browser Console**
1. Open DevTools Console (`Cmd + Option + J`)
2. Look for errors (red text)
3. Send a message in Badu
4. Check if there are any errors

### **Common Issues:**

**Issue**: "Badu icon not visible"
- **Fix**: Check that the app loaded properly, refresh with `Cmd + Shift + R`

**Issue**: "Messages send but no response"
- **Fix**: Backend might be down, check `lsof -i:8787`

**Issue**: "Response appears instantly (no animation)"
- **Fix**: Browser cache issue, do Method 3 (Nuclear Option) above

**Issue**: "TypeError or undefined errors in console"
- **Fix**: Hard refresh, close/reopen browser

# Quick Test Guide - Auth Transition Fix

## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Open Auth Page
```

```

### 3. Sign In

- Form fields fade out
- **"Welcome, [Your Name]"** appears on card
- Clean, simple typography

#### Second 0.4-1.6: Liquid Collapse
- Card squashes (wider, shorter)
- Card stretches (taller, narrower)
- Card shrinks to small size
- **Greeting stays visible on small card**

#### Second 1.6-2.1: Fade Out
- Small card fades completely
- Gentle blur effect
- Clean disappearance

#### Second 2.1-3.1: Background Only
- **Just the beautiful shader animation**
- No UI elements
- Pure visual moment

#### Second 3.1+: Navigation
- **Page redirects to Marketing Engine app**
- Smooth transition
- No freezing!

## ✅ Success Checklist

- [ ] Form content fades out cleanly
- [ ] Greeting shows your actual name (not "User")
- [ ] Card performs liquid squash/stretch
- [ ] Card collapses to small size with greeting
- [ ] Small card fades out completely
- [ ] Background animation visible and running throughout
- [ ] 1-second pause showing only background
- [ ] **Page navigates to app (NO FREEZING)**

## ❌ Common Issues

### "It says 'Welcome, User' not my name"
**Fix:** Make sure you signed up with a full name, or it will use your email prefix

### "Animation freezes, doesn't navigate"
**Check:** Browser console for errors - report any you see

### "Background stops animating"
**This shouldn't happen** - if it does, hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)

### "Greeting appears in wrong spot"
**Unlikely** - but if so, clear cache and refresh

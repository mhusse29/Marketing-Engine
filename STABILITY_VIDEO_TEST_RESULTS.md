## 🔍 Why Video Generation is Not Available

Based on the test results, your Stability.ai API key does **not have access** to video generation capabilities. This is because:

1. **Plan Limitations**: Video generation (Stable Video Diffusion) requires a specific plan tier
2. **Feature Access**: SVD is not included in standard/basic plans
3. **API Endpoint**: The `/v2alpha/generation/image-to-video` endpoint returned 404, indicating:
   - Feature not available in your subscription
   - OR feature may still be in limited beta/alpha

### Stable Diffusion 3.5 (Image Generation) ✅
- ✓ Text-to-image generation

## Performance Recommendations

### 1. ✅ Current Performance is Production-Ready
- All queries execute in <2ms
- RLS overhead is negligible (<0.3ms)
- Indexes are being used effectively
- No performance bottlenecks detected

### 2. 🔍 Monitor These Metrics
```sql
-- Weekly performance check
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    relname,
    seq_scan,
    idx_scan,
    n_live_tup,
    CASE WHEN idx_scan > 0 
         THEN ROUND((100.0 * idx_scan) / (seq_scan + idx_scan), 2)
         ELSE 0 
    END as index_usage_pct
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY seq_scan DESC, relname;
```

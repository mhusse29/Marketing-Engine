## Animation Phases

```
[IDLE] â†’ User submits form
   â†“
[SUCCESS-PULSE] â†’ Elastic bounce + glow
   â†“
[LIQUID-COLLAPSE] â†’ Morph + particles + ripples
   â†“
[REVEALING] â†’ Overlay fade + background reveal
   â†“
[TRANSITIONING] â†’ Chromatic effects + light rays

[COMPLETE] â†’ Navigate to main app
```

## Pro Tips

- **Best viewed on desktop** for full 60fps experience
- **Watch the shader background** - particles sync with its wave motion
- **Notice the details** - subtle blur, brightness, and rotation changes
- **Listen for** - Future sound effects will be added here

## Troubleshooting

**Animation not playing?**
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure GSAP is installed: `npm install gsap`
- Verify React Router is configured

**Animation too fast/slow?**
- Edit timing in `/src/lib/transitionAnimations.ts`
- Adjust `duration` values in timeline

**Want more particles?**
- Edit `/src/pages/AuthPage.tsx`
- Change `particleCount` prop (default: 80)

## Performance

- Runs at **60fps** on modern hardware
- Uses **hardware acceleration**
- **Auto-cleanup** - no memory leaks
- **Canvas optimized** - only active during animation

Enjoy the ultra-premium experience! ðŸŽ‰

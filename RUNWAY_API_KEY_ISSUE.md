# ‚ö†Ô∏è Runway API Key Issue Detected

## Test Results

I've run comprehensive tests on the Runway API and discovered the root issue:

### What We Tested:
1. ‚úÖ API key is present in `server/.env`
2. ‚úÖ API endpoint is correct (`https://api.dev.runwayml.com/v1/text_to_video`)
3. ‚úÖ Request format is correct
4. ‚úÖ Aspect ratios are correct (`1280:720`, etc.)
5. ‚ùå **ALL model names return 403 "Model not available"**

### Models Tested (All Failed with 403):
- `gen3a_turbo`
- `gen3a`
- `gen3_turbo`
- `gen3`
- `gen-3a-turbo`
- `gen-3a`
- `gen-3-turbo`
- `gen-3`
- `runway-gen3`
- `runway-gen3-turbo`
- `text-to-video`
- `default`

## The Problem

The 403 "Model variant is not available" error for **ALL** model names indicates one of these issues:

### 1. API Key Doesn't Have Gen-3 Access
Your Runway API key may not have permissions to use Gen-3 models. This could be because:
- The account tier doesn't include Gen-3 access
- Gen-3 access needs to be explicitly enabled
- The API key was created before Gen-3 was added to your account

### 2. Runway Changed Model Names/Access
Runway may have:
- Deprecated Gen-3 API access
- Moved to Gen-4 only
- Changed how models are specified
- Restricted Gen-3 to certain plans

### 3. Account Issue
- Insufficient credits
- Account not verified
- API key expired or revoked
- Billing issue

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Check Runway Dashboard
1. Log into https://app.runwayml.com/
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí API Keys
3. Check your API key permissions
4. Verify which models you have access to
5. Check if Gen-3 is available in your plan

### Option 2: Generate New API Key
1. Delete the current API key
2. Create a new one with Gen-3 permissions
3. Update `server/.env` with the new key

### Option 3: Upgrade Account (If Needed)
If Gen-3 requires a higher tier:
1. Check pricing page
2. Upgrade to plan with Gen-3 access
3. Regenerate API key after upgrade

### Option 4: Try Gen-4 Instead
If Runway has moved to Gen-4:
1. We can update the code to use Gen-4 models
2. Gen-4 may have different model names
3. Would need to test with: `gen4_turbo`, `gen4`, etc.

## Temporary Solution

Until the API key issue is resolved, here are your options:

### A. Mock Video Generation
We can implement a mock video generator that:
- Shows the UI working
- Demonstrates the flow
- Returns placeholder videos
- Allows testing other features

### B. Use Different Provider
If you have access to:
- Runway Gen-4 (different model names)
- Alternative video AI services
- We can integrate those instead

### C. Wait for API Access
- Resolve the API key issue with Runway
- Then enable video generation

## How to Proceed

**Please choose one:**

1. **Check your Runway account** - Verify Gen-3 access and regenerate API key if needed
2. **Try Gen-4** - I can test if your key works with Gen-4 models
3. **Mock for now** - Implement placeholder video generation while resolving API access
4. **Different provider** - Use alternative video generation service

Let me know which option you prefer, and I'll implement it accordingly! üé¨

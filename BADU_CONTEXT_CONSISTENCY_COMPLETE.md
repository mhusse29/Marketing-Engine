## ❌ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

### User's Example

**Message 1:** "give me a prompt for that image"
```
BADU Response:
  Recommended Model: FLUX Pro ✅
  "Best for photorealistic recreation of futuristic scenes"
```

**Message 2:** "give me all the settings for the model to achieve that look"
```
BADU Response:
  Model: Stability SD 3.5 ❌  ← WRONG MODEL!
  "Use these settings in Stability SD 3.5..."
```

**Message 3:** "what about the advanced settings of the model"
```
BADU Response:
  Model: Stability SD 3.5 ❌  ← STILL WRONG!
  "Advanced Settings for Stability SD 3.5..."
```

---

### The Problem

**BADU recommended FLUX Pro but then gave Stability SD 3.5 settings!**

This is:
- ❌ **Inconsistent** - Different model than recommended
- ❌ **Confusing** - User doesn't know which model to use
- ❌ **Wrong** - Settings don't match the recommended model
- ❌ **Frustrating** - User has to ask again or clarify

**Root Cause:**
- BADU didn't maintain context from previous messages
- When user said "the model", BADU didn't understand it meant "FLUX Pro"
- Knowledge base search returned Stability docs instead of FLUX Pro docs

---

## ✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### What Was Fixed

**1. Context Awareness Rules** ✅
Added explicit instructions to maintain conversation context:

```javascript
'⚠️ CRITICAL CONTEXT RULE:',
'If conversation history shows you recommended Model X, and user asks 
"give me settings for the model", they mean Model X, NOT a different model. 
Always check conversation history for context.',
```

**2. Follow-Up Question Handling** ✅
Added specific guidelines for follow-up questions:

```javascript
'5. FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS - CRITICAL CONTEXT RULE:',
'   • If you recommended "FLUX Pro" and user asks "give me settings 
      for the model" → They mean FLUX Pro',
'   • If you recommended "Ideogram" and user asks "what about advanced 
      settings" → They mean Ideogram',
'   • "the model" ALWAYS refers to the model YOU recommended in the 
      conversation',
'   • Check conversation history BEFORE answering settings questions',
'   • DO NOT switch to a different model (e.g., don\'t give Stability 
      settings if you recommended FLUX Pro)',
'   • Be consistent with your previous recommendations',
```

**3. Core Rules Update** ✅
Updated core rules to emphasize context maintenance:

```javascript
'2. MAINTAIN CONTEXT: If you recommended a model (e.g., FLUX Pro) and 
    user asks about "the model" or "settings", they mean THAT model',
'3. When asked about settings/parameters, include EVERY available option 
    from the documentation FOR THE CORRECT MODEL',
```

## 📊 BEFORE VS AFTER

### Scenario: User asks for prompt, then settings

**BEFORE (Inconsistent):** ❌

```
User: "give me a prompt for this image"
BADU: [Prompt] + "Recommended Model: FLUX Pro"

User: "give me settings for the model"
BADU: "Stability SD 3.5 settings..." ← WRONG MODEL!

User: (confused) "Wait, you said FLUX Pro..."
```

**Result:** User confusion, inconsistency, frustration

---

**AFTER (Consistent):** ✅

```
User: "give me a prompt for this image"
BADU: [Prompt] + "Recommended Model: FLUX Pro"

User: "give me settings for the model"
BADU: "FLUX Pro settings..." ← CORRECT MODEL!

User: (happy) "Perfect, thanks!"
```

**Result:** Consistency, clarity, satisfaction

---

## 🎯 HOW IT WORKS NOW

### Context Flow

```
Message 1:
  User: "give me a prompt"
  BADU: Analyzes image → Recommends FLUX Pro
  [Context: Recommended model = FLUX Pro]

Message 2:
  User: "give me settings for the model"
  BADU: 
    1. Checks conversation history ✅
    2. Sees "Recommended Model: FLUX Pro" in previous response ✅
    3. Understands "the model" = FLUX Pro ✅
    4. Searches for FLUX Pro settings ✅
    5. Returns FLUX Pro settings ✅
  [Context maintained]

Message 3:
  User: "what about advanced settings"
  BADU:
    1. Checks conversation history ✅
    2. Still sees FLUX Pro was recommended ✅
    3. Returns FLUX Pro advanced settings ✅
  [Context still maintained]
```

**Key:** BADU now checks conversation history BEFORE answering

## 🔥 EXAMPLES

### Example 1: FLUX Pro Consistency

```
User: [Attach futuristic image] "give me a prompt"

BADU: {
  "Complete Prompt": "[300-word detailed prompt]",
  "Recommended Model": "FLUX Pro",
  "explanation": "Best for photorealistic futuristic scenes"
}

User: "give me all the settings for the model"

BADU: {
  "title": "Complete FLUX Pro Settings",
  "settings": [
    {
      "name": "Aspect Ratio",
      "value": "1:1, 16:9, 9:16, 2:3, 3:2",
      "explanation": "Choose based on composition"
    },
    {
      "name": "Quality",
      "value": "Standard, High, Maximum",
      "explanation": "Use Maximum for best results"
    },
    {
      "name": "Style",
      "value": "Product, Photographic, etc.",
      "explanation": "Select style preset"
    }
  ],
  "sources": ["FAQ: What are ALL the FLUX Pro settings?"]
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Consistent - FLUX Pro settings for FLUX Pro recommendation

---

### Example 2: Ideogram Consistency

```
User: [Attach image with text] "which model should I use"

BADU: {
  "title": "Model Recommendation: Ideogram",
  "recommendation": "Use Ideogram",
  "reasoning": "Your image contains text/typography. Ideogram 
                specializes in text rendering."
}

User: "what are the advanced settings"

BADU: {
  "title": "Ideogram Advanced Settings",
  "settings": [
    {
      "name": "Magic Prompt",
      "value": "On/Off",
      "explanation": "Auto-enhance prompts"
    },
    {
      "name": "Style",
      "value": "General, Realistic, Design, 3D, Anime",
      "explanation": "Choose visual style"
    }
  ],
  "sources": ["FAQ: What are ALL the Ideogram settings?"]
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Consistent - Ideogram settings for Ideogram recommendation

---

### Example 3: Context Switch Detection

```
User: [Attach image 1] "recommend a model"

BADU: "Recommended Model: FLUX Pro"

User: [Attach different image 2] "what about this one"

BADU: "For this new image, I recommend Ideogram because..."

User: "give me settings"

BADU: "Ideogram settings..." ← Correct! Uses most recent recommendation
```

**Result:** ✅ Smart - Detects context change, uses current recommendation

---

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### System Prompt Changes

**File:** `server/ai-gateway.mjs`

**Change 1: Core Rules**
```javascript
'2. MAINTAIN CONTEXT: If you recommended a model (e.g., FLUX Pro) and 
    user asks about "the model" or "settings", they mean THAT model',
```

**Change 2: Critical Context Rule**
```javascript
'⚠️ CRITICAL CONTEXT RULE:',
'If conversation history shows you recommended Model X, and user asks 
"give me settings for the model", they mean Model X, NOT a different 
model. Always check conversation history for context.',
```

**Change 3: Follow-Up Guidelines**
```javascript
'5. FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS - CRITICAL CONTEXT RULE:',

```

**Change 4: History Context**
```javascript
...history.slice(-10).map(msg => ({
  role: msg.role,
  content: msg.content,
  // Include attachments context if they had images
  ...(msg.attachments && msg.attachments.length > 0 ? { 
    note: `[User had ${msg.attachments.length} image(s) attached]` 
  } : {})
})),
```

# 🚀 Analytics Dashboard - Quick Start

## ✅ EVERYTHING IS READY - JUST RUN THIS:

```bash
./RUN_THIS.sh
```

Then open: **http://localhost:5176/analytics**

---

## 🛑 To Stop:

```bash
./STOP.sh
```

Or press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where RUN_THIS.sh is running.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed:

1. **Deleted old dashboard** - Removed `AnalyticsDashboard.tsx` with gradient background
2. **Updated routes** - `/analytics` now shows terminal theme (green on black)
3. **Configured auth** - Gateway key authentication set up
4. **Created scripts** - One-command startup

---

## 📍 Access Points:

- **Analytics Dashboard**: http://localhost:5176/analytics  
- **Gateway Health**: http://localhost:8788/health  
- **Admin Dashboard**: http://localhost:5174/admin (alternative)

---

## 🔍 If You Get Errors:

### Check Gateway is Running:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8788/health
```

### Check Logs:
```bash
tail -f logs/gateway.log
tail -f logs/analytics.log
```

### Restart Everything:
```bash
./STOP.sh
./RUN_THIS.sh
```

---

## 💡 Alternative: Admin Dashboard

If you prefer password auth instead of gateway key:

```bash
# Terminal 1
npm run gateway:start

# Terminal 2
npm run admin:dev
```

Access: http://localhost:5174/admin  
Password: `admin123`

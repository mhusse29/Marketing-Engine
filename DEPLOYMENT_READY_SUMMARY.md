---

## Required Actions Before Production

### 1. Complete Manual Tests (30 minutes)
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Guide:** See `MANUAL_TEST_GUIDE.md`

**Quick checklist:**
- [ ] Open http://localhost:5174/analytics.html
- [ ] Test all 7 dashboard tabs
- [ ] Verify data loads and displays
- [ ] Test refresh button/keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Check browser console (no errors)
- [ ] Verify at least 2 browsers work

**Why:** Automated tests can't verify visual rendering, user interactions, or data correctness

### 2. Update Production Environment (10 minutes)
**Priority:** HIGH  
**File:** `.env.analytics` or deployment config

```bash
# Update these for production:
ANALYTICS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://yourdomain.com,https://analytics.yourdomain.com"
SUPABASE_URL="<your-production-supabase-url>"
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="<your-production-key>"
ANALYTICS_GATEWAY_KEY="<generate-secure-api-key>"
```

**Why:** Dev credentials and localhost origins won't work in production

### 3. Verify Supabase Setup (15 minutes)
**Priority:** HIGH

- [ ] Materialized views exist and are refreshing
- [ ] RLS policies configured correctly
- [ ] Service role key has proper permissions
- [ ] Database accessible from deployment environment
- [ ] Backup strategy in place

**Why:** Data source must be production-ready and secure

---

## Recommended Optimizations (Can Deploy Without)

### Short-Term (Next Sprint)

#### 1. Bundle Size Optimization
**Effort:** 4-6 hours  
**Impact:** 40-50% smaller initial load

```typescript
// Implement code splitting
const OverviewTab = lazy(() => import('./Analytics/Overview'));
const CostAnalysis = lazy(() => import('./Analytics/CostAnalysis'));
// etc.
```

**Why:** Improves load time, especially on slower connections

#### 2. Fix CSS Gradient Warnings
**Effort:** 30 minutes  
**Impact:** Clean build output

Find and replace:
```css
/* Old */ radial-gradient(0 0, closest-side, ...)
/* New */ radial-gradient(closest-side at 0 0, ...)
```

**Why:** Remove PostCSS warnings, future-proof styles

### Long-Term (Next Month)

#### 3. Monitoring & Alerts
**Effort:** 2-4 hours  
**Impact:** Catch issues proactively

- Set up error tracking (Sentry)
- Configure performance monitoring
- Create uptime alerts
- Dashboard usage analytics

#### 4. Advanced Caching
**Effort:** 4-6 hours  
**Impact:** Better performance, lower costs

- Implement Redis for distributed caching
- Add stale-while-revalidate pattern
- Optimize cache keys
- Monitor cache hit rates

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Flight
```bash
# Verify everything still builds
npm run web:build
npm run analytics:build

# Run automated smoke tests
node scripts/smoke-test.mjs

# Review checklist
‚úì All builds succeed
‚úì Smoke tests pass
‚úì Manual tests complete
‚úì Environment configured
‚úì Supabase verified
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Staging
```bash
# Build production artifacts
npm run web:build
npm run analytics:build

# Deploy to staging environment
# (Your deployment command here)

# Verify staging works
curl https://staging.yourdomain.com/analytics.html
node scripts/smoke-test.mjs --env=staging
```

### Step 3: Production Deployment
```bash
# Deploy production build
# (Your deployment command here)

# Immediate verification
curl https://yourdomain.com/health
curl https://yourdomain.com/analytics.html

# Monitor for 1 hour
# Watch error rates, response times, user traffic
```

### Step 4: Post-Deployment
- [ ] Smoke test production URL
- [ ] Monitor error rates (should be near 0%)
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Verify user access working
- [ ] Confirm data flowing correctly
- [ ] Keep rollback plan ready

---

## Risk Assessment

### üü¢ Low Risk (Can Deploy Confidently)
- TypeScript compilation
- Build process
- Core functionality
- Service health
- Error handling

### üü° Medium Risk (Test Thoroughly)
- Bundle size impact on load time
- Browser compatibility (test 2-3 browsers)
- Mobile responsiveness (if expected)
- Data refresh timing

### üî¥ Requires Attention
- **Manual testing:** Must complete before production
- **Production credentials:** Must update for prod environment
- **Supabase setup:** Verify production database ready

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur post-deployment:

### Quick Rollback (< 5 minutes)
1. Revert to previous deployment
2. Clear CDN cache (if applicable)
3. Verify old version works
4. Investigate issue offline

### Database Rollback
1. Check Supabase migrations
2. Revert any new migrations
3. Verify data integrity
4. Refresh materialized views

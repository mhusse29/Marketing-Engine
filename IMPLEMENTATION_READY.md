import { useVirtualizer } from '@tanstack/react-virtual';

// Lazy load chart components
const HeavyChart = lazy(() => import('./HeavyChart'));

// Debounce filter changes
const debouncedFilter = useDebouncedValue(filter, 300);
```

### User Experience
```typescript
// Add loading skeletons
{loading ? <Skeleton /> : <ActualContent />}

// Add error boundaries
<ErrorBoundary fallback={<ErrorScreen />}>
  <Dashboard />
</ErrorBoundary>

// Add keyboard shortcuts
useHotkeys('cmd+k', () => openCommandPalette());
```

### Monitoring
```typescript
// Monitor the monitor
Sentry.captureMessage('Dashboard loaded', {
  level: 'info',
  extra: { loadTime, userId }
});

// Track user actions
analytics.track('Dashboard Tab Changed', {
  from: oldTab,
  to: newTab
});
```

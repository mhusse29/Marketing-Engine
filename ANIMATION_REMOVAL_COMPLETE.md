## 🎯 Current State

### Content Panel (`src/cards/ContentVariantCard.tsx`)
```tsx
{loading ? (
  <div className="px-4 pt-5 pb-5 space-y-4">
    {/* Loading animation will go here */}
  </div>
) : status === "error" ? (
```
**Line 48-50** - Ready for your animation

### Pictures Panel (`src/components/Cards/PicturesCard.tsx`)
```tsx
  </div>
</CardShell>
```
**After line 357** - Add your animation here

### Video Panel (`src/components/Cards/VideoCard.tsx`)
```tsx
  </div>
</CardShell>
```
**After line 207** - Add your animation here

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For You:
1. Provide your new loading animation code
2. I will implement it in all three panels
3. Test by clicking the Generate button

### What You'll Need to Provide:
Choose one of these options:

**Option A**: Complete component code
```tsx
// Example format
export function MyLoadingAnimation({ status }: { status?: string }) {
  return (
    <div className="...">
      {/* your animation */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Option B**: Animation library/package
```
npm package name and usage instructions
```

**Option C**: Inline JSX
```tsx
// Just the JSX to insert directly
<div className="animate-spin ...">
  {/* your animation */}
</div>
```

## 💡 Recommendations

### For Best Results:

1. **Use absolute positioning** for overlay animations:
   ```tsx
   className="absolute inset-0 flex items-center justify-center"
   ```

2. **Match the app's design**: 
   - Dark theme with glassmorphism
   - Colors: cyan (#00b3ff), blue (#3E8BFF)
   - White text with opacity variants

3. **Consider the status prop**:
   - Show different animations for different states
   - `queued`, `thinking`, `rendering`

4. **Keep it smooth**: Use framer-motion for animations
   ```tsx
   <motion.div
     initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
     animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
     exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
   >
   ```

---

## 🎨 Design Context

Your app has:
- **Dark theme** with glassmorphism effects
- **Gradient accents** (blue to cyan to purple)
- **Smooth transitions** using framer-motion
- **Modern, minimal UI** with rounded corners

Consider an animation that:
- Complements the existing aesthetic
- Is not too distracting
- Provides clear feedback that work is in progress
- Works well on dark backgrounds

- `src/ui/NanoGridBloom.tsx`
- `src/ui/PerimeterProgressSegmented.tsx`

**Options**:
- Keep as reference
- Delete if not needed
- We can remove them after new animation is confirmed working

---

## ✅ Verification

All changes verified:
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ All imports cleaned up
- ✅ Placeholder comments added
- ✅ Files properly formatted

## 📞 Ready When You Are!

I'm ready to implement your new loading animation as soon as you provide it.

**Just send me:**
- The animation component code
- OR the animation library/package name
- OR inline JSX for the animation

**I'll handle:**
- ✅ Creating the component file (if needed)
- ✅ Adding imports to all panels
- ✅ Implementing in all three panels
- ✅ Testing for any errors
- ✅ Final verification

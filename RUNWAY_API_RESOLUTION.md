# üîç Runway API Access Investigation - Complete Analysis

## Test Summary

I've tested **40+ different model name variations** and **multiple API endpoints**. Here's what we know:

### ‚úÖ Confirmed Working:
1. API key is valid and authenticates successfully
2. No 401 unauthorized errors
3. Server recognizes the key
4. Request format is correct

### ‚ùå The Problem:
Every single model returns: `403 - "Model variant [name] is not available"`

### üìä Your Dashboard Shows:
- **Tier 1** access
- **Gen-3 Alpha Turbo** - 50 daily generations, $100/month
- **Gen-4 Turbo** - 50 daily generations, $100/month  
- **Gen-4 Aleph** - 50 daily generations, $100/month
- **Act Two, Upscale, Veo-3** - Also available

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

The disconnect between dashboard access and API access suggests:

### Most Likely Cause:
**Web UI access ‚â† API access**

Runway may require you to:
1. **Enable API access** separately in settings
2. **Generate a new API key** with video permissions
3. **Verify your account** for API usage
4. **Accept API terms** or complete additional setup

### How to Resolve:

#### Step 1: Check API Settings in Dashboard
1. Click on your organization name (top left)
2. Go to **Settings** or **API Keys**
3. Look for:
   - "Enable API Access" toggle
   - "API Permissions" section
   - "Generate New API Key" with checkboxes for features
   - Any warnings or notices about API access

#### Step 2: Regenerate API Key with Permissions
If you see options to enable specific features:
1. Delete current API key
2. Create new one
3. Check boxes for: "Video Generation", "Gen-3", "Gen-4"
4. Copy new key to `server/.env`

#### Step 3: Check Billing/Verification
- Ensure payment method is added
- Verify email if needed
- Check for any pending verifications

#### Step 4: Contact Runway Support
If steps 1-3 don't help:
- Use the help/support button in dashboard
- Explain: "My tier shows Gen-3/Gen-4 access but API returns 403"
- Ask for correct model parameter names for API

## Alternative Explanation

The dashboard might be showing **all Runway models** (what exists) rather than **your specific access**. But your screenshot clearly shows YOUR tier limits, so this seems less likely.

## Immediate Solution

While you resolve the API access, I can implement one of these:

### Option A: Mock Video Generation (15 minutes)
```javascript
// Professional mock that simulates real behavior
- Shows realistic loading times (3-5 seconds)
- Returns beautiful placeholder videos
- Demonstrates all UI features
- Enables testing and development
```

**Pros:** Everything works immediately, no waiting  
**Cons:** Not real videos (but great for demos)

### Option B: Hybrid Approach (20 minutes)
```javascript
// Try real API, fall back to mock gracefully
- Attempts Runway API first
- If 403, uses mock videos
- Logs attempt for debugging
- Seamless user experience
```

**Pros:** Auto-enables when API works, no code changes needed  
**Cons:** Slightly more complex

## Recommendation

üéØ **Implement Option B (Hybrid)** while you:

1. Check Runway dashboard for API enablement
2. Regenerate API key if needed
3. Contact Runway support if stuck

This way:
- ‚úÖ App works perfectly NOW
- ‚úÖ Automatically uses real API when available
- ‚úÖ No waiting or blocking
- ‚úÖ Professional user experience

Shall I implement the hybrid mock system? It will take about 20 minutes and make everything fully functional! üé¨‚ú®
